"""
A Python 2.7 implementation of the DREAMzs MCMC sampler (Vrugt et al., 2009, 
Laloy and Vrugt, 2012) tailored to the geostatistical inverse problems considered in 
Laloy et al. (2017).  This DREAMzs implementation is based on the 2013 DREAMzs Matlab code 
(version 1.5, licensed under GPL3) written by Jasper Vrugt (FYI: a more recent Matlab code
with many more options is available at http://faculty.sites.uci.edu/jasper/). 

Version 0.0 - October 2016. Probably a bit non-pythonic coding and not optimized for 
speed, but the does the job and the forward model evaluations can be performed in 
parallel on several cores.
